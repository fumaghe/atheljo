        <h1>STORViX Launches Avalon WebApp: Data Control, Redefined</h1>
        <h2>From Insight to Action — The Future of Real-Time Telemetry Begins Now</h2>

        <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong> <em>Lund, Sweden – April 2, 2025</em></p>

        <p>STORViX is proud to unveil <strong>Avalon</strong>, a next-generation web application engineered to transform the way organizations interact with real-time system data. Designed for internal operations and analytics, Avalon is the culmination of strategic restructuring from the original Archimedes Analyzer, offering an intuitive, secure, and dynamic platform for enterprise telemetry management.</p>

        <h2>What’s Available in the First Demo</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure OTP Login & Password Change:</strong> A robust multi-step authentication system, including dynamic password strength evaluation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Immediate access to real-time system metrics, interactive charts, and alerts overview.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Section:</strong> Explore detailed breakdowns by company, system, and pool — complete with State Vector Analysis and a fully functional Health Score engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Account Management:</strong> A pyramid structure lets administrators configure sub-accounts, assign company visibility, and manage granular permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings & Support:</strong> Password update, feature toggles, and access to in-app documentation for an optimal user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Avalon?</h2>
        <p>Avalon is more than a dashboard — it’s a strategic hub for operational intelligence. It bridges data silos by integrating SQL and NoSQL databases into one seamless interface, offering both depth and clarity in every interaction.</p>

        <h2>System Health at a Glance</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Health Score</strong> system analyzes key metrics — capacity, performance, telemetry, snapshots, and MUP — to deliver a real-time indicator of system efficiency. This feature helps teams prioritize actions and maintain optimal performance.</p>

        <h2>Security You Can Trust</h2>
        <p>Built with enterprise-grade security protocols, Avalon ensures all user access is authenticated, logged, and protected. Password policies and secure login flows uphold the platform’s integrity and user trust.</p>

        <h2>Flexible Subscription Plans</h2>
        <p>Whether you need the essentials or advanced analytics, Avalon offers three subscription tiers — <strong>Essential</strong>, <strong>Advantage</strong>, and <strong>Premiere</strong> — each crafted to unlock relevant features for every type of user.</p>

        <h2>Where We're Headed</h2>
        <p>While this release focuses on core functionality, our roadmap includes Forecasting, Advanced Reports, Enhanced Alert History, and full customization across analytics views. With every update, Avalon moves closer to becoming the all-in-one telemetry solution for enterprises.</p>
        <p><em>Our official roadmap will be published soon with details on upcoming features.</em></p>

        <h2>Future Integrations</h2>
        <p>Avalon will soon support predictive analytics and machine learning modules, leveraging its modular architecture for scalable deployments across multiple environments.</p>

        <h2>A Word from the Data Science Team</h2>

        <h2>Who Should Use Avalon?</h2>
